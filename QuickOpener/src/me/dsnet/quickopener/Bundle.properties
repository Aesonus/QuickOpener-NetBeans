OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    <p>Sometimes while programming in NetBeans you want to explore a particular file that you are editing on the file system browser, or maybe launch a command in a terminal to do something with it.\
    </p>\n\n<p>This plugins brings to your NetBeans six action, three of them always available and three of them available when the selected node has a file assiociated with it. \
    In particular:</p>\n\n<p><em>When the selection has a valid file:</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open the default OS shell</strong> on the location of the file (or its folder) selected.\
    </li>\n<li><strong>Open the file system browser</strong> on the location of the file (or its folder) selected.\
    </li>\n<li><strong>Copy to the clipboard</strong> the path of the file selected.\
    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Always enabled:</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Launch a shell command</strong> (with parameters, customizable on preferences)</li>\n<li><strong>FileSystem browser on any location</strong> (favorites, customizable on preferences)</li>\n<li><strong>Open a shell on any location</strong> (favorites, customizable on preferences)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>\n<a href="https://github.com/kinkadzs/QuickOpener-NetBeans/wiki/Home">The project is hosted on github, click here to report a bug or make a suggestion...\
